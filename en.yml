# Link submission pages.

submit-title: Submit a Link
submit: |
  <p>This page technically <strong>does not</strong> let you submit any old
  link. You can only use this page to force a Webmention, if your blog software
  doesn't support it.</p>

  <p>This means you still need to have <strong>the sub link in the blog entry</strong>
  that you are submitting. (As described <a href="/howto/{{lang}}">here</a>!)</p>

  <p>If you've done the three steps from that page and now need to force a
  Webmention, well, without any ado:</p>

  <form id="forcesub" method="POST" action="/webmention/{{lang}}">
    <h3>Link to Your Blog Entry</h3>
    <input class="entry" type="text" name="source" value="" />

    <h3>Name of the Sub</h3>
    <input class="entry" type="text" name="target" value="/{{lang}}/hottubs" />
    <p>(<em>/{{lang}}/hottubs</em> is our testing sub.)</p>

    <input class="button" name="submit" type="submit" />
  </form>

submitted-title: "Okie, Sweet!"
submitted: |
  <p>Your link has been force-mentioned. Look for it to show up soon
  <a href="{{link}}">on the sub</a>.</p>

about-title: "What is Indieweb.xyz?"
about: |
  <p>Indieweb.xyz is a syndication service&mdash;meaning you can notify us when
  you've posted on your blog and we'll link back to you. The whole thing is organized
  like Reddit into <em>subs</em>, which are topic-based (usually) collections of links.</p>

  <p>The trick is: <u>you may only post to one sub</u>. <em>(If you post to multiple subs,
  those additional posts are marked as crossposts, which no one sees by default.)</em></p>

  <p>Ok, if you're ready to start posting, <a href="/howto/{{lang}}">here's</a> how. You can also use
  Indieweb.xyz to submit links from other places and to <em>upvote</em>
  links&mdash;both are accomplished through <a href="/howto/bookmark/{{lang}}">bookmarks</a>.

  <h3>What's Wrong With Just Using Reddit?</h3>

  <p>I realize I just made a Reddit comparison, but that only applies to the organization
  by sub.</p>

  <p>Everything else is different:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Self-promotion is encouraged.</strong> You have material that you
      are writing or building and you want a community to see it. This whole site
      facilitates that.</li>
    <li><strong>Your posts are on your blog.</strong> Rather than posting on a
      social media site where layout options are limited and you are thrown into
      a busy plaza where everyone is talking, on Indieweb.xyz a link to you
      redirects to <em>your</em> blog
      with your own unusual design and your own history.</li>
    <li><strong>No algorithm.</strong> Neither upvotes nor your past habits influence
      the sub. The newest entries appear first. (This has the nice side effect of
      pushing a link to the top when it is <em>bookmarked</em> again, since it is
      considered updated.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are massive advantages to Reddit: lots of users, wikis and moderation,
  and your stuff will likely live on there forever.</p>

  <p>So do both. Share here <em>and</em> there.</p>

  <h3>Is Indieweb.xyz a Silo?</h3>

  <p>Ok, so. Yes. Sort of. But here's the thing.</p>

  <p>Even in a decentralized world, you still need some silos. You need a central
  point of discovery. Otherwise, everything is dispersed and detached with only
  small connections&mdash;no large, exhaustive ones. Wikipedia is a silo&mdash;a useful one!</p>

  <p>Ok, but the good thing is: Indieweb.xyz stores very little! It doesn't store your
  posts or your comments. It simply stores a link to you. And any metadata I can get
  from that link.</p>

  <p>This means that anyone else out there can link to that stuff and I own nothing.
  You can change all your syndication links to a new silo in a few minutes. Fire off
  your Webmentions and you're setup somewhere else. Webmentions can be troublesome,
  but this is the amazing benefit of them.</p>

  <h3>What About Spam?</h3>

  <p>Well, yes. So&mdash;fighting spam requires an algorithm or a lot of manual
  work. Spam is an unsolved topic for now.</p>

  <p>Thing is: the Modern Web has traded spam for clickbait. The algorithms are
  there to prevent spam. So spam has now figured out how to game the system.</p>

  <p>On the bright side, there is no (and will be no) advertising here. So that's
  a start!</p>

  <h3>I Want to Read More!</h3>

  <p>Sure, sure. Settle down. There's a bit more.</p>

howto-post: |
  <p>So you've got an essay to share? Or a comment to make on one of our subs? And,
  strangely enough, there's no box to log in!</p>

  <p>Yeah, well, I'm not responsible for any of that. You'll have to do all that
  from your own blog. If your blog is set up with
  <a href="https://indieweb.org/webmention">Webmentions</a>, then it's pretty
  simple:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Write the essay or the comment out on your blog as an entry.<br />
      <span class="note">(Your blog entry must be surrounded by <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry">class="h-entry"</a>.)</span></li>
    <li>Add a link in that blog entry <u>to the indieweb.xyz sub</u> you want to post to.<br />
      <span class="note">(And that link must be marked <a href="https://indieweb.org/u-syndication">class="u-syndication"</a>.)</span></li>
    <li>Publish the entry.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Your blog software should fire off the Webmention to Indieweb.xyz and your
  post should show up on the sub you linked to.</p>

  <h3>Doing It With Style</h3>

  <p>Since you're going to have to link to the sub, why not make it look good?
  The simplest way of doing this is to just put the link at the end of your post
  like this:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>This was also posted to
  <a href="https://indieweb.xyz/{{lang}}/hottubs" class="u-syndication">/{{lang}}/hottubs</a>.</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The code for this is:</p>

  <textarea>
  <p><em>This was also posted to
  <a href="https://indieweb.xyz/{{lang}}/hottubs" class="u-syndication">/{{lang}}/hottubs</a>.</em></p>
  </textarea>

  <p>Better yet, consider putting this link in with the blog entry details - wherever
  you put the time, number of comments, etc. for the entry.</p>

  <p><strong>You can only directly post to one sub!</strong> Whichever Indieweb.xyz link
  is discovered first in your post is the one that will be used.</p>

  <p>Links beyond the first are treated as <em>cross-posting</em>. You may crosspost
  to other subs if you like. Just keep in mind that most people will have cross-posting
  turned off.</p>

  <h3>Indieweb.xyz Etiquette</h3>

  <p>Well, this isn't just about good etiquette. You may run into our spam filter if you
  post to too many different subs or fire off too many Webmentions.</p>

  <p>Subs will be less valuable if you treat them like hashtags. Rather than filling a
  post with hashtags that will fire off in all directions&mdash;which devalues the
  hashtag&mdash;you commit to a single sub. This increases the value of that sub
  because you're invested in using it.</p>

  <p>Beyond a spam filter, Indieweb.xyz has no tools for reporting links or domains.
  In a way, it operates more like a mailing list where anyone can post and we all
  end up driving each other crazy! (Really, the larger a community gets, the higher
  the chances are that someone in the group will drive you nuts.)</p>

  <p>So please try to be polite, active without spamming, give the benefit of the
  doubt. And, failing that, write an extension yourself to killfile the scum.
  But, no, this is the Indieweb&mdash;<a href="https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct">here</a>
  are the rules.</p>

  <h3>What If My Blog Doesn't Have Webmentions?</h3>

  <p>Well then you're going to need to submit your link by hand. <a href="/submit/{{lang}}">Right here.</a></p>

  <p>But, yeah, get Webmentions. This will get tiresome.</p>

  <h3>Why Is This All So CONVUHLUTED??</h3>

  <p>Wait, is that bad? Ok, yeah, it's bad. It's bad. It's fun? Yeah, of course
  it's fun. It's bad!</p>

  <p>Think of it like this: all the work has been moved to your blog.
  Rather than to a social&mdash; sosh&mdash; a search engine or a soshulll&mdash;
  gluggluglug. I'm sorry my gag reflex is preventing me from finishing this
  paragraph!</p>

  <p>The benefit is that people will read your posts on your actual blog.
  This could be nice for you!</p>

  <h3>What Do I Do If I Run Into a Problem?</h3>

  <p>I am working on a good answer to this!</p>

  <h3>How Long Will This Site Even Be Up?</h3>

  <p>Two years at least. That puts us at July 2020. If it's still quite useful
  at that time, I'll continue it.</p>

  <h3>I'm a Nerd&mdash;Anything Else Advanced That I Can Do?</h3>

  <p>For sure. If you want to trick out your user page, you'll need
  all of the following setup on your blog:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Get an <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-card">h-card</a>.</li>
    <li>Use <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a> to connect your Twitter
      and all that if you honestly need it.</li>
    <li>Mentions from <em>rel="me"</em> links will be grouped under your name.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I don't know. You're the nerd. Nerd out on IndieWeb idealism!</p>

howto-bookmark: |
  <p>Okay, so this is Level Two in your training. Here's how to share a link to
  another blog. Don't worry if the link has already been posted. On Indieweb.xyz,
  a reposted bookmark counts as a kind of <em>upvote</em>.</p>

  <p>To do this, you post on your blog again. You still do a Webmention, but you
  also do an Indieweb <a href="https://indieweb.org/bookmark">Bookmark</a>.
  The process is:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Post the bookmark on your blog as a new blog entry.<br />
      <span class="note">(And that link must be marked <a href="https://indieweb.org/bookmark">class="u-bookmark-of"</a>.)</span></li>
    <li>Include the Indieweb.xyz sub link in the entry, as described in the <a href="/howto/{{lang}}">How to Post</a>.</li>
      <span class="note">(The entry must be <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry">class="h-entry"</a> with a link marked <a href="https://indieweb.org/u-syndication">class="u-syndication"</a>.)</span></li>
    <li>Publish the entry.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Code for this is along the lines of:</p>

  <textarea rows="7">
  <p class="p-summary">
  <a class="u-bookmark-of" href="http://othersite.example.com/permalink47">Othersite's Groundbreaking Permalink47.</a>
  I did found this to be quite memorable.</p>
  <p><em>This was also posted to
    <a href="https://indieweb.xyz/{{lang}}/hottubs" class="u-syndication">/{{lang}}/hottubs</a>.</em>
  </p>
  </textarea>

  <p>The link itself will be posted to the sub. Not your blog entry or a link to your blog entry.
  You will still get credit for posting this on the sub. If someone else has already posted
  the link, the bookmark count of that link will tick up.</p>

  <p><strong>The same exact link cannot be double-posted.</strong> If you post a duplicate, it
  will be treated similar to a like or upvote.</p>

  <h3>Can I Use This to Link to Something That Doesn't Use Webmentions?</h3>

  <p>That's insane!! That's just what I was going to talk about!!</p>

  <p>Many times you might want to share directly a PDF of some research or an image.
  Something you're not tracking Webmentions on.</p>

  <p>Yeah, so. Use this same kind of bookmark!</p>

howto-sub: |
  <p>How do you create a sub? Simply <a href="/howto/{{lang}}">post</a> to the sub and it will appear!</p>

  <h3>How Does "Show XYZ" Work?</h3>

  <p>The <a href="/{{lang}}/show-xyz">/{{lang}}/show-xyz</a> sub is for putting up your
  projects for display. Crossposts are allowed here. This way you can show your
  creation on a relevant sub&mdash;and it'll also show up on the Show XYZ sub.</p>

  <p>Oh and this sub can <em>auto-post</em>. If you start the title of your
  entry with the phrase <strong>Show XYZ</strong>, it'll be crossposted to
  /{{lang}}/show-xyz.</p>

  <h3>How Does "Ask XYZ" Works?</h3>

  <p>And the <a href="/{{lang}}/ask-xyz">/{{lang}}/ask-xyz</a> sub works identically!
  This sub is for asking open questions to anyone watching the sub out there.
  You can crosspost here safely as well.</p>

  <p>As for auto-posting, same deal: if you start your entry with the phrase
  <strong>Ask XYZ</strong>, it'll auto-post to /{{lang}}/ask-xyz, too.</p>

  <h3>What is the Hottubs Sub?</h3>

  <p>Oh and <a href="/{{lang}}/hottubs">/{{lang}}/hottubs</a> is the testing sub. Bonus
  if you post a pleasing bit of encouragement to the spa and whirlpool crowd!</p>

  <p><strong>PLEASE DO NOT POST ABOUT THE 2010 WORLD SAUNA CHAMPIONSHIPS!!</strong>
  I mean my God.</p>

  <h3>How About the Indieweb Sub?</h3>

  <p>Nothing too special about <a href="/{{lang}}/indieweb">/{{lang}}/indieweb</a> itself.
  Just want to remind anyone posting to this sub to also post to
  <a href="https://news.indieweb.org/">IndieNews</a>, the progenitor of this site.
  The idea for XYZ was born simply by visiting IndieNews.</p>

  <p>Thank you to Aaron Parecki for IndieNews, both its concept and code.</p>
